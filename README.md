# Description
- Tic Tac Toe is a classic paper-and-pencil game where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

- This implementation of Tic Tac Toe allows you to play against an AI opponent. The player uses 'X' as their symbol, while the AI uses 'O'. The game ends when one player achieves a winning combination or when all spaces on the board are filled without a winner, resulting in a draw.

# Features
- Play against an AI opponent.
- Simple and intuitive interface.
- Responsive design for different screen sizes.

# Technologies Used
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript: The game is built using these fundamental web technologies for the frontend.
- Confetti Animation: Used to provide a celebratory effect when a player wins.
- DOM Manipulation: JavaScript is used to manipulate the Document Object Model to update the game board and handle user interactions.
- Randomized AI Logic: The AI opponent makes moves randomly from available empty spaces on the board.
